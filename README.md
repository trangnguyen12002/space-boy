# What is Space Boy?
An 8x8 bits, sci-fi game that I built for my boyfriend's birthday. We share a love for interactive fiction games and an even bigger love for nostalgia. The game is packed with virtual sociality, a longing for places yet lived, and a strong sense of nostalgia. 

I would like to thank my sister and my bestfriend for encouraging me to move forward with this ambitious project (6 months!) and my boyfriend for enduring my occasional disappearance from the face of Earth to work on this game.

## Demonstration of Game Functions

The game's illustrations were drawn entirely by me and I was really going for a minimalist feel. I decided to keep a 3 color palette for my artworks throughout the game. 

1. Avartar, Dialogues, and Artwork

It was a struggle to make sure the Avatar retrieves the key and opens the correct door. I ensured this by enforcing a single entryway between two Rooms. 

2. Inventory Tracking

Silly, tunneling effects for all transition because for context, the game is set in a Doomsday setting, so I really wanted to achieve that nauseating sense of time and space in my game.
  
3. Transition Effects

Animations that took way too much time and brain cells from me, but absolutely worth it!
